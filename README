Usage
-----

One sticky element:

<div class='mySticky'>
	sticky menu
</div>

jQuery('.mySticky').sticky();



Multiple sticky elements:

<div class='mySticky'>
	sticky content one
</mySticky>
<div class='mySticky'>
	sticky content two
</mySticky>

jQuery('.mySticky').sticky();



Caveats
-------
This is code version 0.1.0.

- Untested on IEs
- Cannot pass y position: it is assumed fixed elements are stuck to the top
- Cannot unstick elements (for instance let the user remove a sticky bar)
